          Through an economic but precise process, that is, the laser cutting, the aim of the project is to express the formal quality of the birds with a minimum of elements.

          Diploma Project<br /><br />
          Supervised by Jasper Morrison<br /><br />

          This project questions how a designer can contribute to the evolution of an object : it takes one of the worldâ€™s most visible and mass-produced chairs and improves it both visually and technically. The chair consists of 3 U-shaped tubes which are interconnected to form the structure with one more crossing bar to brace the front legs. The U-shaped backrest tube provides a simpler structuring solution to this kind of aluminum armchair which also gives a simpler back view to the chair. Besides, when many chairs are gathered at a cafe, its makes a significant difference to the atmosphere.
